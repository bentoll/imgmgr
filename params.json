I still\r\nhave a lot of ideas I will implement, but my goal is to create a non-database dependent \r\nphoto browser for the web app that is efficient and extremely simple. If you like what you\r\nsee, feel free to contribute or send me feedback/ideas. The app/documentation are not \r\ncomplete, but useable!\r\n\r\nphp/js Image Manager/Browser\r\n- \tYour original images are not modified.\r\n- \tThis web app will generate (resized) images and thumbnails, and store them in a \r\n\tspecified (settings) folder.\r\n-\tThis web app includes imgmgr.php and admin.php to handle the end user functionality,\r\n\tbut you may use the class on your own in your own web apps.\r\n\r\nFolders (none are required)\r\n-\tcss, images, js\r\n\tThese folders are all for lightbox and jquery used in admin.php and imgmgr.php\r\n-\timgmgr.photos\r\n\tThis folder is where (according to the settings) generated pictures (and their \r\n\tcorresponding folders) will be organized.\r\n-\tphotos\r\n\tThis is the master photo directory where you can put your albums (folders) in. In \r\n\tadmin.php, you can crawl the directory for new add ons. The app will not modify/delete\r\n\tanything in this folder.\r\n\t\r\nFiles\r\n-\tadmin.php\r\n\tThis page will use imgmgr.class.php's admin functions (deleting albums, regenerating\r\n\tall pictures/thumbnails, and finding new content to generate)\r\n-\timgmgr.php\r\n\tThis page will use imgmgr.class.php to display the generated pictures.\r\n-\timgmgr.settings.php\r\n\tThis page has defined settings that will be used by imgmgr.php. \r\n-\timgmgr.class.php\r\n\tThis is the main class that handles all of the image manipulation. \r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n-\tThere is no warrenty for this web app and if you download/fork/run the files in anyway, you are doing so at your own risk.\r\n-\tYou agree to the GPL 3.0 license when using/viewing this web app. The license can be loacted here: http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html\r\n\t","name":"Imgmgr","google":""}
